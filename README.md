# Charmed MongoDB Operator


## Description

The Charmed MongoDB Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [MongoDB Community Edition](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) document database.

MongoDB is a general purpose distributed document database. This operator charm deploys and operates MongoDB (vs 5.0) on physical or virtual machines as a single replica.


## Usage

### Basic Usage
Until the MongoDB Machine Charm is published, you need to follow the build & deploy instructions from [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/canonical/mongodb-operator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to deploy the charm.

After building the charm you may deploy a single unit of MongoDB using its default configuration
```shell
juju deploy ./mongodb_ubuntu-20.04-amd64.charm
```

It is customary to use MongoDB with replication. Hence usually more than one unit (preferably an odd number to prohibit a "split-brain" scenario) is deployed. To deploy MongoDB with multiple replicas, specify the number of desired units with the `-n` option.
```shell
juju deploy ./mongodb_ubuntu-20.04-amd64.charm -n <number_of_replicas>
```

To retrieve primary replica one can use the action `get-primary` on any of the units running MongoDB
```shell
juju run-action mongodb/<unit_number> get-primary --wait
```

Similarly, the primary replica is displayed as a status message in `juju status`, however one should note that this hook gets called on regular time intervals and the primary may be outdated if the status hook has not been called recently.

### Replication
#### Adding Replicas
To add more replicas one can use the `juju add-unit` functionality i.e.
```shell
juju add-unit -n <num_of_replicas_to_add>
```
The implementation of `add-unit` allows the operator to add more than one unit, but functions internally by adding one replica at a time, as specified by the [constraints](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/replSetReconfig/#reconfiguration-can-add-or-remove-no-more-than-one-voting-member-at-a-time) of MongoDB.


#### Removing Replicas 
Similarly to scale down the number of replicas the `juju remove-unit` functionality may be used i.e.
```shell
juju remove-unit <name_of_unit1> <name_of_unit2>
```
The implementation of `remove-unit` allows the operator to remove more than one replica so long has the operator **does not remove a majority of the replicas**. The functionality of `remove-unit` functions by removing one replica at a time, as specified by the [constraints](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/replSetReconfig/#reconfiguration-can-add-or-remove-no-more-than-one-voting-member-at-a-time) of MongoDB.
