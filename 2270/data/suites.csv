"Tests clusters behavior when scaling down a minority and removing a primary replica.

    them, the primary is guaranteed to be one of those minority members.

    1.  when a leader is deleted that the new leader, on calling leader_elected will reconfigure
    the replicaset.
    2. primary stepping down leads to a replica set with a new primary.
    3. removing a minority of units (2 out of 5) is feasiable.
